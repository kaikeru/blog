# Blog
The source files used to create the blog @ blog.kaikeru.com.

## Purpose
The blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as its base and serves as the the personal website for Kyle Wagner. This is also an exercise in how to use the free tools available to publish a website with minimal or no overhead cost other than time.

## Build Pipeline
This repo utilizes the Azure Pipelines add on to convert the Hugo source to a packaged website published at the kaikeru/kaikeru.github.io repo. For more information on that, see the `azure-pipelines.yml` file.
